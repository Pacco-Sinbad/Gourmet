										<h2>Oyster Mushroom Grow Bucket Care<br class="mobile-hide" />
										</h2>
										
									</header>
									<h3>Outdoor Care</h3>
									<p>Keeping your bucket outside is ideal given you can meet certain conditions.<br/>
									1. Keep the bucket out of direct sunligh<br/>
									2. Preferably keep the bucket away from high-traffic areas<br/>
									3. Have a water source nearby</p>
									<p>If these 3 requirements are met, you are all set to grow your mushrooms outside! Pick your location and check on them daily. The key is maintaining moisture in the bucket and at the fruiting sites (the holes in the side of the bucket). There is no need to remove the lids though.
									</p>
									<p>When receiving enough rain and the weather is not so hot that the buckets are drying out you can simply leave them uncovered and monitor them. Judge enough rain the same way you would care for a garden. If you have to water the garden, the buckets may need to be misted as well. This hands-off method will work and yield mushrooms
									</p>
									<p>Daily misting of the buckets can be beneficial as long as the fruiting sites aren't becoming over-saturated. A quick spray with a spray bottle twice a day or with the garden hose will maintain proper moisture levels. When using a garden hose mister, simply sweep the spray over the entire surface of the bucket without stalling at any fruiting sites. This approach will expedite the fruiting process and provide larger flushes in my experience.</p>
									<p>During times of high temperature and little rain, it can be beneficial to cover the buckets with a nonscented plastic bag. This bag will help retain moisture in the straw. Make sure to remove the bag and recover the buckets 1-3 times a day to ensure fresh air exchange. The mycelium needs to breathe to grow properly. 
										With the bag, you may still notice drying if the weather is severely drying. At this point, you can use a hose with a mister setting to spay up into the bag. This will provide a massive amount of moisture. DO NOT SPRAY WATER INTO THE BUCKET. This can drown the mycelium and create an environment for bacterial growth										
									</p>
									<p>Once you notice pins forming, remove the bag permanently and start misting daily. Anything resting on a mushroom cap will create an area for mold to form.</p>
								</article>
								<article class="box post">
									<h3>Indoor Care</h3>
									<p>Keeping your buckets indoors requires a little more investment and oversight, but that doesn't mean you can't do it. You will need what is called a Martha Tent. This is one of those small four-tier greenhouses you can pick up at a garden center. They fit in a closet and are fairly simple to set up. The only additional step needed with the tent is to place it over top of a nonporous material that will collect and contain any dew that forms inside of the tent.</p>
									<p>The reason you need the tent is that most indoor environments are far too dry for the mycelium to grow correctly. This is good for us! We don't want mold and mildew in our homes. This makes things difficult for cultivating mushrooms though. In the tent, we are going to create a humid warm environment. We still need to keep the tent out of direct sunlight because too much heat will cook the mycelium. So a secondary room or closet with a light makes for an optimal space that is out of the way of everyday traffic. The light is important because although mushrooms donâ€™t photosynthesize, they do use light as an indicator of where to grow. Keeping the light on during the day and turning it off at night will be plenty
									</p>
									<p>Check on your mushroom buckets 2-3 times a day and open the tent. You need to do this so that you can mist all sides of the bucket and create fresh air exchange. Continue to do this throughout the cultivation process. Thats it to growing mushrooms inside.

									<h2>After The First Flush<br class="mobile-hide" />
									</h2>
									
								</header>
								<p>Your first flush of mushrooms has started to grow, but when should you harvest them? The ideal time to harvest your mushrooms is just before the cap flattens out fully. The caps form with a domed shape and as they age they will flatten just before releasing their spores. Harvesting them just before the caps edges are completely flat is ideal. The mushrooms will grow in a cluster at the fruiting sites so some of them will still be more domed while others are more mature. If a cluster has some caps that look ready give the whole thing a gentle tug. If it seems like the cluster is releasing from the bucket, give a gentle twist and remove it. If the cluster seems like it is still holding on pretty tight, give it another day for the other caps to mature.</p>
								
								<p>After the first flush and harvest of your mushrooms, the mycelium will have spent a lot of energy. That doesn't mean the bucket is done though. Keep it in the same area and maintain care. You can encourage the substrate to fruit 1-3 more times. Each subsequent flush will have lower yields.
								</p>
								<p>After you think the substrate and mycelium is spent you can empty the container into the compost pile or straight into the garden as a mulch. Spent mushroom media is great for gardens!

								</p>
								<p>The spent and empty buckets can be recycled or can be returned for a discount on a future purchase. Please inquire about returning the buckets to see what sort of discount can be provided.
								</p>
								<p>buckets are also useful for other projects such as a strawberry planter, gathering weeds or vegetables, and other projects in the garden.

									<h2>Troubleshooting<br class="mobile-hide" />
									</h2>
									<h3>Ideally, you won't need this section but things happen and I am here to help.</h3>
								</header>
								
								<p>If you feel like your bucket is lagging behind check the fruiting sites. You are looking for white fuzzy material and moisture. These two signs indicate healthy mycelium and you may just need to wait a little longer. You may even find when inspecting so closely that there are what appears to be very tiny mushrooms. These are called "pins" and are the beginning stages of mushroom developement.
								</p>
								<p>If the fruiting sites are dry and you don't see any mycelium, increase the rate at which you mist the buckets and check to make sure they are not spending long portions of the day exposed to direct sunlight. <br/>DO NOT PUT ANY WATER DIRECTLY INTO THE BUCKET.<br/> This can drown the mycelium and create an environment beneficial to the formation of harmful bacteria. You may also consider covering your buckets with a bag to try and keep in moisture. Please refer back to the outdoor growing guide at the top of the page.
								</p>
								<p>If you see blue or green mold forming this indicates a contamination of the substrate. Contact me to discuss solutions.<br/> <br/>
									If you smell a foul odor this is also an indication of a larger problem. Mycelium will have a sweet earthy smell. Any other smell warrants concern and you should contact me to discuss a solution.
									 
								</p>
								<p>Mushrooms require very little intervention to grow so long as they are kept moist and at a stable temperature. As with any form of gardening or cultivation, patience is key. Let the mycelium do its job and reap the rewards. If you ever have a concern though please feel free to contact me.

									<h4>Are the buckets food grade?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									Absolutely! I source my buckets from a convenience store that has frosting delivered in them. I then clean and alter the buckets for use in mushroom cultivation.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>How many flushes will I get from a bucket?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									You can easily get three flushes. Each flush will diminish in vigor, but it is absolutely worth getting everything you can from the bucket. After you harvest mushrooms continue caring for the bucket as you had been. After a month you should see the mycelium send out more pins.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>What kind of water should I spray my buckets with?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									I use tap water and mist the buckets with my hose nozzle. You can use any water you would feel comfortable watering your plants with.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>Can I request a specific type of mushroom cultivar?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									Definitely! It just may take some time for me to cultivate the spawn to inoculate the straw for the buckets. I absolutely want to cultivate the mushrooms you want to grow though.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>How do I order mushroom buckets?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									Currently my stock fluctuates quite a bit. Because of this I prefer to take purchases through email requests to ensure I can fulfill your order. This is a consequence of being a small upstart. Maybe in the future I will be able to keep more on hand though!
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>What other items do you sell?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									I sell many items that assist in the cultivation of mushrooms! This includes: sterile bird seed for spawn, inoculated spawn jars, food grade mushroom cultivation buckets, ready to grow mushroom cultivaton buckets, and pasteurized straw buckets ready to be inoculated. Look out in the future for even more!
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>What is the best way to know the next time you have a new cultivar for sale?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									You can always check on the website in the purchasing tab to see whats coming up next and whats available. Additionaly you can follow me on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mathias.fcg/">Instagram</a> where I post all my new batches as I work on them.
