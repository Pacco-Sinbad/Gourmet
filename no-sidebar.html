										<h2>Oyster Mushroom Pail Care<br class="mobile-hide" />
										</h2>
										
									</header>
									<h3>Outdoor Care</h3>
									<p>Keeping your pail outside is ideal given you can meet certain conditions.<br/>
									1. Keep the pail out of direct sunligh<br/>
									2. Preferably keep the pail away from high-traffic areas<br/>
									3. Have a water source nearby</p>
									<p>If these 3 requirements are met, you are all set to grow your mushrooms outside! Pick your location and check on them daily. The key is maintaining moisture in the pail and at the fruiting sites (the holes in the side of the pail). There is no need to remove the lids though.
									</p>
									<p>When receiving enough rain and the weather is not so hot that the pails are drying out you can simply leave them uncovered and just monitor them. Judge enough rain the same way you would care for a garden. If you have to water the garden, the pails may need some attention as well.
									</p>
									<p>During times of high temperature and little rain, it can be beneficial to cover the pails with a nonscented plastic bag. This bag will help retain moisture in the straw. Make sure to remove the bag and recover the pails 1-3 times a day to ensure fresh air exchange. The mycelium needs to breathe to grow properly. 
										With the bag, you may still notice drying if the weather is severely drying. At this point, you can use a hose with a mister setting to spay up into the bag. This will provide a massive amount of moisture. DO NOT SPRAY WATER INTO THE PAIL. This can drown the mycelium and create an environment for bacterial growth.
										</p>
									<p>You can also forgo the use of a plastic bag and mist the pails on an everyday to every-other-day basis when dealing with inclement weather. This is just as effective and reduces the need for single-use plastic.</p>
								</article>
								<article class="box post">
									<h3>Indoor Care</h3>
									<p>Keeping your pails indoors requires a little more investment and oversight, but that doesn't mean you can't do it. You will need what is called a Martha Tent. This is one of those small four-tier greenhouses you can pick up at a garden center. They fit in a closet and are fairly simple to set up. The only additional step needed with the tent is to place it over top of a nonporous material that will collect and contain any dew that forms inside of the tent.</p>
									<p>The reason you need the tent is that most indoor environments are far too dry for the mycelium to grow correctly. This is good for us! We don't want mold and mildew in our homes. This makes things difficult for cultivating mushrooms though. In the tent, we are going to create a humid warm environment. We still need to keep the tent out of direct sunlight because too much heat will cook the mycelium. So a secondary room or closet with a light makes for an optimal space that is out of the way of everyday traffic. The light is important because although mushrooms donâ€™t photosynthesize, they do use light as an indicator of where to grow. Keeping the light on during the day and turning it off at night will be plenty
									</p>
									<p>Check on your mushroom pails 2-3 times a day and open the tent. You need to do this so that you can mist all sides of the pail and create fresh air exchange. Continue to do this throughout the cultivation process. Thats it to growing mushrooms inside.

									<h2>After The First Flush<br class="mobile-hide" />
									</h2>
									
								</header>
								
								<p>After the first flush and harvest of your mushrooms, the mycelium will have spent a lot of energy. That doesn't mean the pail is done though. Keep it in the same area and maintain care. You can encourage the substrate to fruit 1-3 more times. Each subsequent flush will have lower yields.
								</p>
								<p>After you think the substrate and mycelium is spent you can empty the container into the compost pile or straight into the garden as a mulch. Spent mushroom media is great for gardens!

								</p>
								<p>The spent and empty pails can be recycled or can be returned for a discount on a future purchase. Please inquire about returning the pails to see what sort of discount can be provided.
								</p>
								<p>Pails are also useful for other projects such as a strawberry planter, gathering weeds or vegetables, and other projects in the garden.

									<h3>Ideally, you won't need this section but things happen and I am here to help.</h3>
								</header>
								
								<p>If you feel like you pail is lagging behind check the fruiting sites. You are looking for white fuzzy material and moisture. These two signs indicate healthy mycelium and you may just need to wait a little longer. You may even find when inspecting so closely that there are what appears to be very tiny mushrooms. These are called "pins" and are the beginning stages of mushroom developement.
								</p>
								<p>If the fruiting sites are dry and you don't see any mycelium, increase the rate at which you mist the pails and check to make sure they are not spending long portions of the day exposed to direct sunlight. <br/>DO NOT PUT ANY WATER DIRECTLY INTO THE PAIL.<br/> This can drown the mycelium and create an environment beneficial to the formation of harmful bacteria. You may also consider covering your pails with a bag to try and keep in moisture. Please refer back to the outdoor growing guide at the top of the page.
								</p>
								<p>If you see blue or green mold forming this indicates a contamination of the substrate. Contact me to discuss solutions.<br/> <br/>
									If you smell a foul odor this is also an indication of a larger problem. Mycelium will have a sweet earthy smell. Any other smell warrants concern and you should contact me to discuss a solution.
									 
								</p>
								<p>Mushrooms require very little intervention to grow so long as they are kept moist and at a stable temperature. As with any form of gardening or cultivation, patience is key. Let the mycelium do its job and reap the rewards. If you ever have a concern though please feel free to contact me.
