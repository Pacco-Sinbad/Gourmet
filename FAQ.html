										<h2>Oyster Mushroom Grow Bucket Care<br class="mobile-hide" />

									<h3>Basic Bucket Care (Revised and Simplified)</h3>
									<p>Your main objective is to provide the bucket and the substrate in it a location with indirect light and high humidity. Outside, this can be under a tree or along a fence line. Inside this can be a garage, a basement, or closet. Humidity is key though, and indoor cultivation will require slightly more upkeep than outdoor if air conditioning is in use.
										<br>To maintain humidity and moisture at the fruiting sites (the holes), mist your bucket 2-3 times per day. This can be accomplished with a standard household cleaner spray bottle filled with water. You can also use a hose nozzle with the mister setting. We are only applying a small amount of water each time. No water should accumulate to the point that it is excessively dripping into the bucket. Water accumulation in the bucket can lead to rotting substrate and contamination.
										<br>The addition of a plastic bag to cover the bucket will help maintain humidity. This is especially true for those growing mushrooms indoors. The bag placed loosely over the bucket will act as a mini green house, keeping moisture from evaporating into the surrounding area. This can be used outside as well during dry weather. The use of typical green houses used for plant cultivation is another great option if available.

												<figcaption class="hideMobile">Buckets coverd to maintain humidity.</figcaption>
											</figure>
										</div>
										<br>As you care for the bucket you will notice white fuzzy growth at the holes. This is the mycelium. The mushroom we eat is the fruiting body of the mycelium. Seeing this indicates the bucket should begin producing mushrooms soon.
										<br>The first sign of mushrooms growing will be "pins". These are very tiny mushrooms that will form in the fruiting sites. These pins will double in size each day. Continue misting the bucket and keep it covered if it already had been, but opt to keep the cover off between the first and last misting of the day to increase fresh air to the mushrooms. The more fresh air they get the larger the caps will be.
										<br>Mushroom caps grow with the edge of the cap turned down. When you see the cap begin to flatten out and the edge begin to turn straight out, this is the time to harvest the cluster. Some of the caps will be behind this point, but it is recommended to harvest the entire cluster at once. You may opt to leave the cluster for another day or two to allow more of the mushrooms to mature further. Harvest your cluster by gently twisting it off the bucket. It should come loose failry easily if it is ready to be harvested.
										<br>At this point take a small needle or other pointed instrument and gently score the area you harvested from. This serves to remove leftover material from the mushrooms just harvested and replace spent substrate with fresh. By doing this you are telling the mycelium "this is a good place for mushrooms to grow again".

											</figure>
										</div>

										<br><br>There will be a month or so between flushes where you should maintain care. The process should repeat itself two to three times. After you feel that the bucket has slowed in prodcution you have a few options.
										<br>1. Find a shady damp area outside to empty the contents of the bucket. Doing so will expose fresh substrate. Continue to mist the substrate and more fruit is likely to appear.
										<br>2. Try mixing the substrate around in the bucket to expose fresh portions to the fruiting sites. The mycelium will be lower in energy than originally but, like the first option, is likely to produce again. This option is good for those without access to an outdoor location for the substrate.
										<br>3. Empty the contents into the garden or compost. Spent mushroom substrate is great for gardens as a soil ammendment.
										<br>4. Throw the substrate away. This option is for those of us without the ability to use the straw further.
										<br> With options one and two, be mindful that there is not mold growth. As the mycelium expends energy and ages it becomes susceptible to contamination. Any mold growth within the substrate should result in placing the contents in the compost or garbage.

									<h3>Basic Bag Care</h3>
									<p>When you first receive your mushroom grow bag you will want to pick a spot for it to live for the next month at a minimum. Your mushrooms will start growing very soon but can take up to a month to fully form. Ideal locations are above the fridge, on the kitchen counter, in a closet, or even in a basement cellar. There are just few conditions that need to be met. You don't want the bag to receive direct sunlight and you want to provide it with ample fresh air. The direct sunlight can dry out the bag and the mushrooms when they start to form and the mushrooms need fresh air to form larger more desirable caps.
									<br> Once you have chose where to keep your bag you will want to make a slice in the plastic halfway up from the bottom roughly half the width of the bag. You don't need to peel the plastic back. The mushroom will readily form at this location and grow through the slice. The fresh air that reaches this new opening will tell the mycelium that this is a good location for the mushrooms to form.
									<br>Now, care will consist of misting your bag twice a day with water. This will be essential all the way through the harvest of your mushrooms. If your mushrooms dry out when they are very little they will not continue to form. Mushrooms will not bounce back from drying out. The pins will shrivel and fall off and you'll have to wait for new ones to grow. A good way to maintain high humidity around the bag is to cover it with a plastic grocery bag. This simple but effective addition will help to ensure the proper level of humidity for your mushrooms.
									<br> Harvesting your mushrooms is as simple as twisting them off the bag. You will know your mushrooms are ready to harvest when the edge of the cap begins to flare out. The caps will grow with the edge curled over. When that edge is near flat or flat you will want to harvest the entire cluster. Some caps will be further along than others. This is fine. It is better to have some younger mushrooms in the cluster than to wait too long.
									<br>What is great about your bag is you can repeat this process at the same location for another harvest. Maintain care and you should notice pins forming again within 2-4 weeks. After that, or if you just want to move on, you can repeat the process with each other face of the bag. This means you can potentially yield 10 flushes of mushrooms when caring properly for the bag!

									<h2>After The First Flush<br class="mobile-hide" />
									</h2>
									
								</header>
								<p>Your first flush of mushrooms has started to grow, but when should you harvest them? The ideal time to harvest your mushrooms is just before the cap flattens out fully. The caps form with a domed shape and as they age they will flatten just before releasing their spores. Harvesting them just before the caps edges are completely flat is ideal. The mushrooms will grow in a cluster at the fruiting sites so some of them will still be more domed while others are more mature. If a cluster has some caps that look ready give the whole thing a gentle tug. If it seems like the cluster is releasing from the bucket, give a gentle twist and remove it. If the cluster seems like it is still holding on pretty tight, give it another day for the other caps to mature.</p>
								
								<p>After the first flush and harvest of your mushrooms, the mycelium will have spent a lot of energy. That doesn't mean the bucket is done though. Keep it in the same area and maintain care. You can encourage the substrate to fruit 1-3 more times. Each subsequent flush will have lower yields. It can also be helpful to gently score the fruiting sites. The abrasion removes spent substrate and risidual fruit fragments, effectively telling the mycelium that this is a good place for mushrooms to grow again.
								</p>
								<p>After you think the substrate and mycelium is spent you can empty the container into the compost pile or straight into the garden as a mulch. Spent mushroom media is great for gardens!
								</p>
								<p>Additionally, you can attempt to squeeze another fruting or two from the substrate.<br>
									I like to empty buckets that have slowed down in production right where I was keeping them outside. The newly exposed mycelium will often produce more fruits. If you are keeping your bucket indoors you can either find a shady damp area to place the substrate outside or try mixing the substrate around so that the fruiting sites have fresh straw in them.<br>With either option be sure to maintain moisture as before.<br> Be mindful of any mold growth though. As the mycelium weakens over time it become susceptible to contamination. Any mold growth is an indication to throw the substrate into a compost pile or the garbage if composting it is not an option.</p>
								<p>The spent and empty buckets can be recycled or returned for a discount on a future purchase. Please inquire about returning the buckets to see what sort of discount can be provided.
								</p>
								<p>Buckets are also useful for other projects such as a strawberry planter, gathering weeds or vegetables, and other projects in the garden.

									<h3>Ideally, you won't need this section but things happen and I am here to help.</h3>
								</header>
								
								<p>If you feel like your bucket is lagging behind check the fruiting sites. You are looking for white fuzzy material and moisture. These two signs indicate healthy mycelium and you may just need to wait a little longer. You may even find when inspecting so closely that there are what appears to be very tiny mushrooms. These are called "pins" and are the beginning stages of mushroom developement.
								</p>
								<p>If the fruiting sites are dry and you don't see any mycelium, increase the rate at which you mist the buckets and check to make sure they are not spending long portions of the day exposed to direct sunlight. <br/>DO NOT PUT ANY WATER DIRECTLY INTO THE BUCKET.<br/> This can drown the mycelium and create an environment beneficial to the formation of harmful bacteria. You may also consider covering your buckets with a bag to try and keep in moisture. Please refer back to the outdoor growing guide at the top of the page.
								</p>
								<p>If you see blue or green mold forming this indicates a contamination of the substrate. Contact me to discuss solutions.<br/> <br/>
									If you smell a foul odor this is also an indication of a larger problem. Mycelium will have a sweet earthy smell. Any other smells warrant concern and you should contact me to discuss a solution.
									 
								</p>
								<p>Mushrooms require very little intervention to grow so long as they are kept moist and at a stable temperature. As with any form of gardening or cultivation, patience is key. Let the mycelium do its job and reap the rewards. If you ever have a concern though, please feel free to contact me.

								<p>
									<h4>Are the buckets food grade?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									Absolutely! I source my buckets from a convenience store that has frosting delivered in them. I then clean and alter the buckets for use in mushroom cultivation.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>How many flushes will I get from a bucket?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									You can easily get three flushes. Each flush will diminish in vigor, but it is absolutely worth getting everything you can from the bucket. After you harvest mushrooms continue caring for the bucket as you had been. After a month you should see the mycelium send out more pins.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>What do I do with my bucket when I think it is done?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									I like to empty buckets that have slowed down in production right where I was keeping them outside. The newly exposed mycelium will often produce more fruits. If you are keeping your bucket indoors you can either find a shady damp area to place the substrate outside or try mixing the substrate around so that the fruiting sites have fresh straw in them. Be mindful of any mold growth though. As the mycelium weakens over time it become susceptible to contamination. Any mold growth is an indication to throw the substrate into a compost pile or the garbage if composting it is not an option.
									<br>Buckets can be returned for future discounts or kept for personal projects. Please recycle your buckets if you choose not to keep them.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>What kind of water should I spray my buckets with?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									I use tap water and mist the buckets with my hose nozzle. You can use any water you would feel comfortable watering your plants with.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>Why won't my bucket fruit again?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									If it hasnt been a month since the last flush I would just give it a little more time to see if pins form. If it has been a month and you see no activity, check the fruting sites to make sure they are still moist. If they are then at this point open the bucket and check if the substrate is still damp. If it seems dry we can rehydrate the bucket by spraying water directly into it. The goal is to spray water in until it reaches the top. You could also consider submerging the bucket with the lid on until the air stops flowing out. Then lie the bucket on its side over night to allow the water to flow out. This will rehydrate the straw without over saturating. When mushrooms grow they draw a lot of moisture from the substrate and at times we need to rehydrate it. This occurs in the wild as well when mushrooms grow on logs. During the wet months we see lots of mushrooms and when it's dry we might not see any until it rains.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>Can I request a specific type of mushroom cultivar?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									Definitely! It just may take some time for me to cultivate the spawn to inoculate the straw for the buckets. I absolutely want to cultivate the mushrooms you want to grow though.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>How do I order mushroom buckets?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									Currently my stock fluctuates quite a bit. Because of this I prefer to take purchases through email requests to ensure I can fulfill your order. This is a consequence of being a small upstart. Maybe in the future I will be able to keep more on hand though!
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>What other items do you sell?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									I sell many items that assist in the cultivation of mushrooms! This includes: sterile bird seed for spawn, inoculated spawn jars, food grade mushroom cultivation buckets, ready to grow mushroom cultivaton buckets, and pasteurized straw buckets ready to be inoculated. Look out in the future for even more!
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>What is the best way to know the next time you have a new cultivar for sale?</h4>
									<h4>A:</h4>
									You can always check on the website in the purchasing tab to see whats coming up next and whats available. Additionaly you can follow me on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mathias.fcg/">Instagram</a> where I post all my new batches as I work on them.
